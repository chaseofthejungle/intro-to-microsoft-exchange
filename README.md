# 1. <a name="defining">Defining Microsoft Exchange</a>

Microsoft Exchange is an on-premises (through Exchange Server software) or cloud-hosted (through a Microsoft 365 Exchange Online subscription) solution for organizational e-mail, calendar, contact, and task services. For e-mail transmissions, Exchange relies on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for such subprotocols as SMTP, POP, and IMAP.

**Some important benefits of using Microsoft Exchange include:**

* Centrally manageable e-mail, calendars, contacts, and tasks.
* The automatic syncing of data for various apps and devices.
* Keeping inboxes secure through anti-spam and anti-malware/anti-virus filtering solutions.
* Keeping inbox messages 'focused' so that the most essential messages remain emphasized.
* Empowering organizations to collaborate through shared data and other resources.

An easy way to draw a distinction between Exchange and Outlook is to consider the core purposes of their functionalities, and how they can integrate together as a full solution: while Outlook provides front-end interfaces (for both desktop and mobile interfaces), Exchange handles the back-end (server-side/data-side). However, both are vital components of Microsoft's e-mail solutions.

| Feature | Exchange | Outlook |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Purpose | *Server* infrastructure app for centrally managing e-mail, contact, calendar, and task services via an administrative adashboard. | UI for *clients*, so that they may directly access and customize e-mail, contacts, and calendars. Intended to sync with Exchange. |
| Purchase | Through Microsoft 365 Exchange Online subscriptions (cloud) or Exchange Server software (on-premises solutions). | Software available as a component of Microsoft Office suite. Included in Office 365 for business packages. |
| Intended Users | Accessed and configured by database operators and network/system administrators. | Accessible by various end users for daily digital interactions. |
| Direct Collaboration | Advanced, granular features for collaboration, with permissions and resource deployments/configurations determined by admins. | Some limited collaborative potential, but lacks the complex features/control of Exchange. |
| Security Potential | Advanced administrative policies can be configured and enforced for organizational, regulatory, and other compliance purposes. | Junk folder for spam e-mails (both automatically and manually/user flagged). |
