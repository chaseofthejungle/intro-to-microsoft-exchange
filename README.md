# 1. <a name="defining">Defining Microsoft Exchange</a>

Microsoft Exchange is an on-premises (through Exchange Server software) or cloud-hosted (through a Microsoft 365 Exchange Online subscription) solution for organizational e-mail, calendar, contact, and task services.

**Some important benefits of using Microsoft Exchange include:**

* Centrally manageable e-mail, calendars, contacts, and tasks.
* The automatic syncing of data for various apps and devices.
* Keeping inboxes secure through anti-spam and anti-malware/anti-virus filtering solutions.
* Keeping inbox messages 'focused' so that the most essential messages remain emphasized.
* Empowering organizations to collaborate through shared data and other resources.
